[{"body":"WingVortex is an unofficial extension for the Vortex mod manager that adds support for installing and managing Project Wingman mods in Vortex, just like any other supported title. To clarify, this project is not affiliated in any way with Nexus Mods, Sector D2 or anyone else, and is an open-source community resource.\nStatus and Limitations WingVortex is still alpha-quality software! While I can test locally, I won’t be able to cover every case and there is a high potential for bugs that haven’t been found yet. The following is definitely supported at this point:\n Installing mods: Installing mods from archive files works, deploying directly to your install directory. Managing mods: The standard Vortex install/enable/disable/uninstall operations should all work just as they do for any other Vortex-managed game. Profiles: Create multiple profiles for different sets of mods and quickly switch between them.  There’s some features that we’ve included to get them in your hands as fast as possible, but might still have some rough edges:\n Improved installation for skins: The extension will now attempt to detect when an archive contains mod files for multiple skins or slots and walk you through installing them.   If you’re really missing specific features you can open an issue and we can discuss the viability, or find me on the Nexus Mods Discord.\n Nexus Mods To be clear and upfront: being supported in Vortex (using WingVortex) does not mean that the Nexus Mods or Vortex team officially supports this extension or any mods you install using it. See the FAQ for extra details.\nThe Nexus team has, however, enabled Vortex integration on Nexus Mods for PW so once you have the extension installed you can use the Vortex buttons on the site to quickly install mods.\n","excerpt":"WingVortex is an unofficial extension for the Vortex mod manager that …","ref":"/docs/introduction/","title":"Introduction"},{"body":" This site includes only the guides for getting started with WingVortex and managing Project Wingman mods with Vortex. For help with Vortex, check out the Vortex Support page.\n Welcome to the User Guide for the WingVortex project!

You don’t! If you prefer installing and managing your mods manually, or using any other modding tools, I recommend using them! WingVortex is just an alternate method of installing mods for those who are more familiar with Vortex already. In particular, installing Project Wingman mods manually is not particularly arduous if you are used to it.\nI’m a mod/pack author, how do I make mods compatible with Vortex? The over-simplified answer is that Vortex works best when a single mod archive (i.e. a file on Nexus Mods) contains just one .pak mod file in it. This is usually impractical for many games (especially with skin mods), so the installer will try to detect and adapt to different mod structures to make installing mods easier, even when they’re not packaged how Vortex likes them.\nIn particular, note that the installer will only deploy .pak files (and sometimes any other files in the folder containing those .pak files), so anything in other folders shouldn’t impact compatibility.\nWhat about mods that aren’t on the Nexus? They should still work fine! Download the archive file and install it using Vortex’s standard “Install from File” button. You might be prompted to choose what files you want installed, and also remember that non-Nexus mods won’t have quite the same metadata available in Vortex you might be used to.\nThe installer prompt failed and now I can’t install my mod?! If you are facing problems installing mods with multiple .pak files, you may have found a problem in the advanced installer that WingVortex uses to cut down on conflicts. First, head to your Settings page in Vortex and turn off the Enable Interactive Installer toggle under the Enable Advanced Installer for Project Wingman section and try to install your mod again.\nIf that works, please raise an issue on GitHub and make sure to link/include which mod you’re trying to install. We’re always trying to improve mod compatibility and you might have just found a bug!\n","excerpt":"Below is a collection of frequent questions and the best answers I can …","ref":"/docs/introduction/faq/","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"body":"Quick Start The fastest way to get started is to just open the Games page in Vortex and scroll down through the unmanaged games. You should see an entry for Project Wingman in there. Click Manage on that entry and follow the prompts to install the extension and restart Vortex. You should be good to go and try installing some mods!\nInstalling the Extension If the quick start doesn’t work or you want to install the extension yourself, there’s a couple of different ways to do that! Unless you’ve got a pretty specific use case, you’ll probably want one of the two automatic methods, but manual installation is available as well.\nAutomatic Installation  This is the easiest way to install!\n  Open up Vortex, and open the Extensions panel from the left sidebar. Click Find more to open the list of Extensions Find Project Wingman Support and click Install Wait for the extension to install and restart Vortex when prompted.  Once Vortex has restarted, just click the Manage button on Project Wingman in your Games screen and you’re ready to install some mods!\nSemi-Automatic Installation If you can’t install directly from the Extensions screen, you can instead install from the archive.\n Download the archive from Nexus Mods or GitHub Open the Extensions panel in Vortex Click on the Drop File(s) box in the corner and locate the archive you downloaded. Wait for the extension to install and restart Vortex when prompted.  Once Vortex has restarted, just click the Manage button on Project Wingman in your Games screen and you’re ready to install some mods!\nManual Installation  Only attempt this if you absolutely have to. It becomes much harder to debug and much harder to upgrade.\n If you want to install the extension yourself, you will have to install the actual extension files manually. Make sure you close Vortex before proceeding.\nFirst, download the archive from Nexus Mods or GitHub.\nNext, unpack the archive to somewhere convenient. You should have a directory named game-projectwingman with at least three files inside:\n info.json index.js gameart.png  Now, copy the whole directory to your Vortex folder. You can easily open your Vortex folder by opening a new File Explorer window and entering the following in to the location bar: %APPDATA%/Vortex and then opening the plugins directory (create it if it doesn’t exist).\nOnce you’re done, you should have three files at the following locations:\nC:\\Users\\\u003cyour-user-name-here\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\game-projectwingman\\info.json C:\\Users\\\u003cyour-user-name-here\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\game-projectwingman\\index.js C:\\Users\\\u003cyour-user-name-here\u003e\\AppData\\Roaming\\Vortex\\plugins\\game-projectwingman\\gameart.png With those files in place, you’re clear to start Vortex and you should see the Project Wingman icon in the Games screen light up.\n","excerpt":"Quick Start The fastest way to get started is to just open the Games …","ref":"/docs/usage/installation/","title":"Installation"},{"body":"At it’s core, installing mods is roughly the same as any Vortex-enabled game, once you’ve added Project Wingman as a managed game in Vortex.\nIf you haven’t already, open the Games screen and click the Manage button on the Project Wingman icon under Unmanaged\n Installing from Nexus Mods If you’re installing mods from Nexus Mods, you can use the “Vortex” or “Download with Mod Manager” buttons on the mod page to automatically open Vortex and download the mod. Simply Install and Enable like usual and you should be good to go.\nInstalling archives with multiple mod files If you install a file from Nexus Mods that has multiple game mod files (i.e. .pak files), you will see a prompt that should walk you through the process of choosing which mod files you want to install.\nInstalling non-mod files If you install non-PAK mod files, such as modding tools or PSM presets, Vortex will still install them so you can manage them like any other mod but note that they might get deployed into slightly different places in your installation\nInstall from archives You can also download mod archives directly from Nexus Mods or anywhere else you like and install them with Vortex. Simply use the Install From File button in the toolbar or drop them onto the drop zone at the bottom of the Vortex window.\n Be aware that installing from non-Nexus archives will often not include the full metadata.

You can do that by opening the Load Order tab from the left panel and you will see a list of your enabled mods in the main view. Drag-and-drop your mods as needed to control the order you want them loaded and the next time your mods are deployed, Vortex will automatically arrange your files in the ~mods folder to ensure they load in the correct order.\n Note that (like all UE4 games), the last mod to modify a resource “wins” so lower mods overwrite higher ones in the list.\n Conflict Detection To help with spotting where you have conflicting mods, WingVortex will automatically scan your installed mods to identify the most common sources of conflicts: aircraft skins and datatable mods (aka blueprint mods).\nWhen your mods are deployed, if any of your enabled mods are replacing the same skin slots or the same data tables you will get a warning notification informing you of the conflict. The game will still load mods even if they are conflicting, so this is often your best bet for spotting mods that may not work together.\nWhen Vortex warns you of a conflict, you can either disable some of the conflicting mods until there are no more conflicts, try your luck in-game anyway (not recommended) or use the PSM Integration to try and merge compatible mods.\n","excerpt":"Many mods won’t require much extra setup or configuration but some …","ref":"/docs/usage/manage-mods/","title":"Managing your installed mods"},{"body":"Project Sicario Merger (PSM) is an experimental new way of building and merging mods for Project Wingman: now available locally on your PC. PSM can build a merged mod on your machine from presets, Sicario patches, PSM-compatible skin mods and even other merged mods, all with less compatibility issues and less downloads required.\nFor more info on Project Sicario Merger (PSM) itself, check out the mod page for Project Sicario Merger, or the Introduction and Getting Started on Project Sicario itself.\nGetting Started with Vortex Vortex (with WingVortex 0.2.1+) has integrated support for merging mods with PSM. Just install PSM from Nexus Mods like any other mod, enable it on the Mods page and then turn on the PSM integration in Settings \u003e Interface. Vortex will automatically run PSM after each deploy and manage your merged mod like any other mod in your mods list.\n","excerpt":"Project Sicario Merger (PSM) is an experimental new way of building …","ref":"/docs/usage/psm-integration/","title":"Project Sicario Merger Integration"},{"body":"Customising metadata You can customise the basic metadata of any of your mods (name, author, notes etc) using Vortex’s built-in sidebar. Just double-click on the name of any mod in your mod list and you’ll get a small dialog where you can change the name and author, or add some notes for yourself. It’s not recommended to change the source or mod type as these control how mods are handled internally.\nProfiles Just like any other Vortex game, you can have multiple profiles configured for different mod selections. Want an easier way to switch between certain sets of skins? Don’t want to use all your wild skins every time you play? Set up profiles and you can easily switch between them to keep your mod installs separate. You can create a new profile from the Profiles screen by either cloning your exising one (from the Edit dropdown menu), or clicking Add “Project Wingman” Profile.\nChecking installed files If you installed a mod using the guided installer, it’s possible you only installed some .pak files from the original mod archive. If you need to check which files you installed for any reason, you can find them in the mod details panel. Double click the relevant mod in the Mods list and scroll down in the panel on the right to find out how many files you installed. Click on the summary (i.e. 2 installed files) to see exactly which files you chose to isntall.\nPurging to default If you want to take your game back to a default, unmodded state, you can use Vortex’s Purge feature. Click the Purge Mods button from the Mods list and Vortex will undeploy all your enabled mods, leaving your game directory essentially unmodded.\nRemoving or resetting WingVortex If you want to completely reset WingVortex so that you can start over from scratch, first uninstall all your currently installed mods from the Mods list. Once you’ve done that (and deployed!) jump to the Profiles screen, and choose Remove from the dropdown menu beside the edit button for the “Project Wingman - Default” profile. This will effectively reset your Vortex so that Project Wingman will reappear as an available, unmanaged game in the Games list.\nTo remove WingVortex entirely, you should uninstall and remove all your installed mods from the Mods list first. After deploying, you can then remove the Default profile (see above), and finally uninstall the extension itself by clicking over to the Extensions screen. WingVortex will appear near the end of the list as “Game: Project Wingman”. Click Remove to uninstall WingVortex.\n Note that Project Wingman will still show up in your Games list since Vortex can redownload the extension from Nexus Mods.\n Multiple Installation Variants If you don’t like the specific skin/slot choices you made when you installed one of your mods, remember that you can always reinstall the mod and use Vortex’s variant functionality to easily switch between multiple versions of the same mod without affecting the rest of your mod list.\n","excerpt":"Customising metadata You can customise the basic metadata of any of …","ref":"/docs/usage/advanced/","title":"Advanced options and configuration"},{"body":"Despite common opinion on the matter, not everyone wants to manually install mods, no matter how easy you find it to be. As such, making your mod compatible is incredibly easy and helps users.\nThe most obvious way to make your mod incompatible is requiring manual steps like renaming files. In fact, if you use file renames to achieve this (things like .pakx files) users will see a warning recommending they not install the mod. If you have optional alternate files, just include them as separate downloads, or use an installer. Equally, don’t use subfolders to try and force a load order: Vortex will flatten all mod files into one folder. Just use file names to get the same effect as UE4 loads files alphabetically.\n If you have a truly weird install scenario that needs something more than that, contact @agc93 first.\n ","excerpt":"Despite common opinion on the matter, not everyone wants to manually …","ref":"/docs/usage/authors/","title":"Notes for Mod Authors"},{"body":" This release is now available on Nexus Mods.\n This release is the next alpha of the Project Wingman extension!\nThis one’s another minor update, adding support for detecting embedded Project Sicario presets/requests.

Once the Vortex update is available the extension should auto-update. The previous 0.2.2 release will continue to be available for 1.4 users until the 1.4.15 update.\nWingVortex and the Microsoft Store Vortex (after the 1.4.15 update) should support installing and deploying mods for the Microsoft Store version of Project Wingman, but this is unsupported. That means I’ll try my best to keep it working, but I provide no guarantees, and I generally can’t help you with debugging problems with the Microsoft Store version.\nMy recommendation for this game is simple: if you like Project Wingman and want to be able to mod your game without limits or hacks buy it on Steam or GOG.\nChanges  Added experimental support for XGP/Microsoft Store installs  The existing setup process would fail for Microsoft Store installs due to missing permissions.
