  Installing and using Project Sicario Merger to merge compatible mods in Vortex.
---

Project Sicario Merger (PSM) is an experimental new way of building and merging mods for Project Wingman: now available locally on your PC. PSM can build a merged mod on your machine from presets, Sicario patches, PSM-compatible skin mods and even other merged mods, all with less compatibility issues and less downloads required.

For more info on Project Sicario Merger (PSM) itself, check out the [mod page for Project Sicario Merger](https://www.nexusmods.com/projectwingman/mods/270), or the [Introduction](https://sicario.modding.app/merger) and [Getting Started](https://sicario.modding.app/merger-start) on Project Sicario itself.

## Getting Started with Vortex

Vortex (with WingVortex 0.2.1+) has integrated support for merging mods with PSM. Just install [PSM from Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/projectwingman/mods/270) like any other mod, enable it on the Mods page and then turn on the PSM integration in Settings > Interface. Vortex will automatically run PSM after each deploy and manage your merged mod like any other mod in your mods list.
