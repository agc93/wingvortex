  How to install and view your mods in Vortex.
---

At it's core, installing mods is roughly the same as any Vortex-enabled game, once you've added Project Wingman as a managed game in Vortex.

If you haven't already, open the Games screen and click the **Manage** button on the Project Wingman icon under *Unmanaged*

## Installing from Nexus Mods

If you're installing mods from Nexus Mods, you can use the "Vortex" or "Download with Mod Manager" buttons on the mod page to automatically open Vortex and download the mod. Simply Install and Enable like usual and you should be good to go.

### Installing archives with multiple mod files

If you install a file from Nexus Mods that has multiple game mod files (i.e. `.pak` files), you will see a prompt that should walk you through the process of choosing which mod files you want to install.

### Installing non-mod files

If you install non-PAK mod files, such as modding tools or PSM presets, Vortex will still install them so you can manage them like any other mod but note that they might get _deployed_ into slightly different places in your installation

## Install from archives

You can also download mod archives directly from Nexus Mods or anywhere else you like and install them with Vortex. Simply use the *Install From File* button in the toolbar or drop them onto the drop zone at the bottom of the Vortex window.

> Be aware that installing from non-Nexus archives will often not include the full metadata. You can double-click the mod in the mod list to change its details.
